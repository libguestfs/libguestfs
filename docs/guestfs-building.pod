=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=head2 Short cut for Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) users

On Fedora, use L<dnf(8)> to install all the requirements:

 dnf builddep libguestfs

On systems still using L<yum(8)>, do:

 yum-builddep libguestfs

=head2 Short cut for Debian or Ubuntu users

Use APT to install all the requirements:

 apt-get build-dep libguestfs

If that command doesn't work, take a look at the Debian source package
L<http://packages.debian.org/source/libguestfs>, at the list of
C<build-depends> and C<build-depends-indep>, and install everything
listed there.

=head2 Full list of requirements

=over 4

=item F<appliance/packagelist.in>

Install as many package names found in this file as possible.  (It is
not strictly required to install all of them).

I<Note>: If you build libguestfs followed by installing appliance
packages, the build will not pick them up automatically, even if you
do S<C<make clean>>.  You have to do this command to clean the old
supermin appliance and force a new one to be prepared:

 make -C appliance clean-supermin-appliance

=head1 BUILDING FROM GIT

 sudo dnf install gettext-debel
 git clone https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs
 cd libguestfs
 ./autogen.sh
 make

=head1 BUILDING FROM TARBALLS

Download and unpack the tarball.

 cd libguestfs-1.xx.yy
 ./configure
 make

=head1 RUNNING THE TESTS

B<DO NOT run the tests as root!>  Libguestfs can be built and tested as
non-root.  Running the tests as root could even be dangerous, don't do
it.

To sanity check that the build worked, do:

 make quickcheck

To run the basic tests, do:

 make check

There are many more tests you can run.  See L<guestfs-hacking(1)>
for details.

=head1 INSTALLING

B<DO NOT use C<make install>!>  You'll end up with conflicting versions
of libguestfs installed, and this causes constant headaches for users.
See the next section for how to use the F<./run> script instead.

Distro packagers can use:

 make INSTALLDIRS=vendor DESTDIR=[temp-build-dir] install

=head1 THE ./run SCRIPT

You can run L<guestfish(1)>, L<guestmount(1)> and the virt tools
without needing to install them by using the F<./run> script in the
top directory.  This script works by setting several environment
variables.

For example:

 ./run guestfish [usual guestfish args ...]

 ./run virt-inspector [usual virt-inspector args ...]

The F<./run> script adds every libguestfs binary to the C<$PATH>, so
the above examples run guestfish and virt-inspector from the build
directory (not the globally installed guestfish if there is one).

You can use the script from any directory.  If you wanted to run your
own libguestfs-using program, then the following command will also
work:

 /path/to/libguestfs/run ./my_program [...]

You can also run the C programs under valgrind like this:

 ./run valgrind [valgrind opts...] virt-cat [virt-cat opts...]

or under gdb:

 ./run gdb --args virt-cat [virt-cat opts...]

This also works with sudo (eg. if you need root access for libvirt or
to access a block device):

 sudo ./run virt-cat -d LinuxGuest /etc/passwd

To set environment variables, you can either do:

 LIBGUESTFS_HV=/my/qemu ./run guestfish

or:

 ./run env LIBGUESTFS_HV=/my/qemu guestfish

=head1 F<local*> FILES

Files in the top source directory that begin with the prefix F<local*>
are ignored by git.  These files can contain local configuration or
scripts that you need to build libguestfs.

I have a file called F<localconfigure> which is a simple wrapper
around F<autogen.sh> containing local configure customizations that I
need.  It looks like this:

 . localenv
 ./autogen.sh \
     -C \
     --enable-werror \
     "$@"

So I can use this to build libguestfs:

 ./localconfigure && make

If there is a file in the top build directory called F<localenv>, then
it will be sourced by C<make>.  This file can contain any local
environment variables needed, eg. for skipping tests:

 # Use an alternate python binary.
 export PYTHON=python3
 # Skip this test, it is broken.
 export SKIP_TEST_BTRFS_FSCK=1

Note that F<localenv> is included by the top Makefile (so it's a
Makefile fragment).  But if it is also sourced by your
F<localconfigure> script then it is used as a shell script.

=head1 SELECTED ./configure SETTINGS

There are many C<./configure> options.  Use:

 ./configure --help

to list them all.  This section covers some of the more important
ones.

=over 4

=item B<--disable-appliance --disable-daemon>

See L</USING A PREBUILT BINARY APPLIANCE> below.

=item B<--disable-erlang>

=item B<--disable-gobject>

=item B<--disable-golang>

=item B<--disable-haskell>

=item B<--disable-lua>

=item B<--disable-ocaml>

=item B<--disable-perl>

=item B<--disable-php>

=item B<--disable-python>

=item B<--disable-ruby>

Disable specific language bindings, even if C<./configure> finds all
the necessary libraries are installed so that they could be compiled.

Note that disabling OCaml or Perl will have the knock-on effect of
disabling large numbers of virt tools and parts of the test suite.

=item B<--disable-fuse>

Disable FUSE support in the API and the L<guestmount(1)> tool.

=item B<--disable-gnulib-tests>

On some platforms the GNUlib test suite can be flaky.  This disables
it, since errors in the GNUlib test suite are often not important.

=item B<--disable-static>

Don't build a static linked version of the libguestfs library.

=item B<--enable-install-daemon>

Normally L<guestfsd(8)> is not installed by C<make install>, since
that wouldn't be useful (instead it is "installed" inside the supermin
appliance).  However if packagers are building "libguestfs live" then
they should use this option.

=item B<--enable-werror>

This turns compiler warnings into errors (ie. C<-Werror>).  Use this
for development, especially when submitting patches.  It should
generally I<not> be used for production or distro builds.

=item B<--with-default-backend=libvirt>

This controls the default method that libguestfs uses to run qemu (see
L<guestfs(3)/BACKEND>).  If not specified, the default backend is
C<direct>, which means libguestfs runs qemu directly.

Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) E<ge> 7 use this flag to
change the default backend to C<libvirt>, because (especially in RHEL)
the policy is not to allow any program to run qemu except via libvirt.

Note that despite this setting, all backends are built into
libguestfs, and you can override the backend at runtime by setting the
C<$LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND> environment variable (or using API methods).

=item B<--with-extra=">I<distroname>=I<version>,libvirt,...B<">

=item B<--with-extra="local">

This option controls the "extra" field returned by
L<guestfs(3)/guestfs_version> and also printed by virt tools'
I<--version> option.  It is a free text field, but a good idea is to
encode a comma-separated list of facts such as the distro name and
version, whether libvirt is the default backend, and anything else
that may help with debugging problems raised by users.

For custom and/or local builds, this can be set to C<local> to
indicate this is I<not> a distro build.

=item B<--without-libvirt>

Compile libguestfs without libvirt support, even if libvirt
development libraries are installed.

=item B<--with-gtk=2>

This option forces virt-p2v to be built against Gtk 2, which is
currently the most widely tested configuration.

=item B<--with-qemu=">bin1 bin2 ...B<">

Provide an alternate qemu binary (or list of binaries).  This can be
overridden at runtime by setting the C<LIBGUESTFS_HV> environment
variable.

=item B<--with-qemu-options=">-M ... -cpu ...B<">

If qemu requires extra options to work on this platform, you can pass
them here, and they will be used both when testing and running qemu.

=item B<--with-supermin-packager-config=>I<yum.conf>

This passes the I<--packager-config> option to L<supermin(1)>.

The most common use for this is to build the appliance using an
alternate repository (instead of using the installed yum/dnf/apt/etc
configuration to find and download packages).  You might need to use
this if you want to build libguestfs without having a network
connection.  Examples of using this can be found in the Fedora
C<libguestfs.spec> file (see L</BUILDING A PACKAGE FOR FEDORA> below
for resources).

=item B<--with-supermin-extra-options=">--opt1 --opt2 ...B<">

Pass additional options to L<supermin(1)>.  See
F<appliance/make.sh.in> to understand precisely what this does.

=item B<PYTHON>

This environment variable may be set to point to a python binary
(eg. C<python3>).  When C<./configure> runs, it inspects this python
binary to find the version of Python, the location of Python libraries
and so on.  See
L</BUILDING PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON 3 BINDINGS> below.

=item B<SUPERMIN>

This environment variable can be set to choose an alternative
L<supermin(1)> binary.  This might be used, for example, if you want
to use a newer upstream version of supermin than is packaged for your
distro, or if supermin is not packaged at all.  On RHEL 7, you must
set C<SUPERMIN=/usr/bin/supermin5> when compiling libguestfs.

=back

=head1 NOTES ABOUT QEMU AND KVM

A common problem is with broken or incompatible qemu releases.

Different versions of qemu have problems booting the appliance for
different reasons.  This varies between versions of qemu, and Linux
distributions which add their own patches.

If you find a problem, you could try using your own qemu built from
source (qemu is very easy to build from source), with a "qemu
wrapper".  See L<guestfs(3)/QEMU WRAPPERS>.

By default the configure script will look for qemu-kvm (KVM support).
KVM is much faster than using plain qemu.

You may also need to enable KVM support for non-root users, by
following these instructions:
L<http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/FAQ#How_can_I_use_kvm_with_a_non-privileged_user.3F>

On some systems, this will work too:

 chmod 0666 /dev/kvm

On some systems, the chmod will not survive a reboot, and you will
need to make edits to the udev configuration.

=head1 USING CLANG (LLVM) INSTEAD OF GCC

 export CC=clang
 ./configure
 make

=head1 USING A PREBUILT BINARY APPLIANCE

To understand what the libguestfs appliance means, see
L<guestfs-internals(1)>.

If you are using non-Linux, or a Linux distribution that does not have
L<supermin(1)> support, or simply if you don't want to build your own
libguestfs appliance, then you can use one of the prebuilt binary
appliances that we supply:
L<http://libguestfs.org/download/binaries/appliance>

Build libguestfs like this:

 ./configure --disable-appliance --disable-daemon
 make

Set C<$LIBGUESTFS_PATH> to the path where you unpacked the appliance
tarball, eg:

 export LIBGUESTFS_PATH=/usr/local/lib/guestfs/appliance

and run the libguestfs programs and virt tools in the normal way,
eg. using the F<./run> script (see above).

=head1 BUILDING PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON 3 BINDINGS

The F<./configure> script detects the currently installed version of
Python using whatever program is called C<python> in the current
C<$PATH>.  Libguestfs will build Python 2 or Python 3 bindings as
appropriate.

You can override this behaviour by specifying an alternate Python
binary, eg:

 PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 ./configure

To build parallel Python 2 and Python 3 bindings, you will need to
build libguestfs twice.  The second time, you can disable all the
other bindings and tools and just build the Python bindings.  See the
Fedora spec file (see below) for a complete example of how to do this.

=head1 BUILDING A PACKAGE FOR FEDORA

The Fedora spec file is stored under:
L<http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/libguestfs.git/>

Libguestfs is built in Fedora using the ordinary Fedora build system
(Koji).

=head1 BUILDING A PACKAGE FOR RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) builds of libguestfs are heavily
patched.  There are broadly two types of patches we apply:

=over 4

=item *

We disable many features that we do not wish to support for RHEL
customers.  For example, the "libguestfs live" feature is disabled.

=item *

We backport upstream features.

=back

The patches we apply to RHEL releases are available publically in the
upstream git repository, in a branch called C<rhel-x.y>

For example, the RHEL 7.3 patches are available here:
L<https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/commits/rhel-7.3>

The sources and spec files for RHEL versions of libguestfs are
available on L<https://git.centos.org/project/rpms>, and see also
L<https://wiki.centos.org/Sources>.

=head1 BUILDING i686 32 BIT VIRT-P2V

I<(This section only applies on the x86-64 architecture.)>

Building a 32 bit virt-p2v (i686) binary improves compatibility with
older hardware.  See L<virt-p2v-make-disk(1)> for details.  Although
virt-p2v is a simple Gtk application, it is not especially easy to
build just virt-p2v as a 32 bit application on a 64 bit host.  Usually
the simplest way is to use a 32 bit chroot or even a 32 bit virtual
machine to build libguestfs.

On Fedora you can use the L<mock(1)> tool.  For example:

 fedpkg mockbuild --root fedora-23-i386

This will result in a F<virt-v2v-*.i686.rpm> file which can be
unpacked to extract the 32 bit virt-p2v binary.

The binary may be compressed to either F<p2v/virt-p2v.i686.xz>, or
F<$libdir/virt-p2v/virt-p2v.i686.xz> or
F<$VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR/virt-p2v.i686.xz> as appropriate.  This enables
the L<virt-p2v-make-disk(1)> I<--arch> option.
