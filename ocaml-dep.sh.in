# Usage:
#   .depend: *.mli *.ml
#       $(top_builddir)/ocaml-dep.sh $^
#   -include .depend

set -e

# List of directories that contain common OCaml libraries.  If it
# contains OCaml code that can be included from another directory,
# then it should go here.  Note that OCaml modules in these
# directories must have unique names (eg. not â€˜Utilsâ€™) else
# dependencies don't get built right.
