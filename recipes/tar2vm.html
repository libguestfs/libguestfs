<h2>Make a virtual machine out of a tarball</h2>

<p>
This script shows how you might generate a whole virtual
machine, or a disk image for a virtual machine, starting
with a tarball that contains the content for the machine.
</p>

<p>
The usage is:
</p>

<pre>
tar2vm.sh input.tar.gz output.img 100M
</pre>

<p>
where (for example) <code>100M</code> is the size of the output
disk image.  You have to specify a size that is large enough to contain all
the contents of the tarball, but not too large that there is too much
wasted space (unless you want to give the VM extra working space of
course).
</p>
