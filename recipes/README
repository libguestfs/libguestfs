This directory contains guestfish-based shell which give some useful
recipes to follow.

These also get copied to the website here:
http://et.redhat.com/~rjones/libguestfs/recipes.html

The format for each recipe is:

  foo.sh           Shell script, using guestfish.
  foo.html         HTML snippet describing the recipe (should start
                   with <h2>..</h2> giving the title of the recipe)
  foo.example      Plain text snippet showing example output.

Everything in the recipes/ directory may be used and distributed
without restrictions.

To run a script before libguestfs has been installed, you can do
something like this:

  LIBGUESTFS_PATH=../appliance PATH=../fish:$PATH ./show-devices.sh disk.img

You can apply these recipes in your own programs by translating the
guestfish commands into API calls in the language of your choice.  The
translation is a simple 1-1 mapping.
