 * =item C<"max">
 *
 * The literal string C<"max"> means use C<-cpu max> (the best

 * =item some string
 *
 * Some string such as C<"cortex-a57"> means use C<-cpu cortex-a57>.

 * C<NULL> means no C<-cpu> option at all.  Note returning C<NULL>
 * does not indicate an error.

 * choices in QEMU:
 *
 * =over 4
 *
 * =item *
 *
 * The default for C<qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt> is to emulate a
 * C<cortex-a15> (WTF?).
 *
 * =item *
 *
 * We don't know for sure if KVM will work, but C<-cpu host> is broken
 * with TCG, so we almost always pass a broken C<-cpu> flag if KVM is
 * semi-broken in any way.
