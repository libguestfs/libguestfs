guestfs-gobject - How to use libguestfs with the GObject bindings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

From Javascript using gjs:

 const Guestfs = imports.gi.Guestfs;
 var g = new Guestfs.Session();
 g.add_drive('disk.img', null);
 g.launch();
 g.close();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents how to call libguestfs using GObject
bindings, especially from Javascript.

Note that the GObject bindings have problems handling 64 bit values.
You should not use the GObject bindings if there are native bindings
for your language.  For example, to use libguestfs from Python you are
strongly advised to use the Python native bindings instead (see
L<guestfs-python(3)>).

This page just documents the differences from the C API and gives some
examples.  If you are not familiar with using libguestfs, you also
need to read L<guestfs(3)>.

=head1 JAVASCRIPT

Using gjs, you can write a C<.js> file containing:

 const Guestfs = imports.gi.Guestfs;
 var g = new Guestfs.Session();
 g.add_drive('disk.img', null);
 g.launch();
 g.close();

and then run it using:

 gjs program.js
