For next major stable release (1.24)
------------------------------------

* Allow remote libvirt volumes to be accessed.  This requires some
  enhancements to libvirt which have been agreed but not yet
  implemented.

Bugs assigned to 1.24 (put "1.24" in the Devel Whiteboard field in
Bugzilla):

Beyond 1.24
-----------

* Make 'guestfish --ro' be the default, and get users to use
  'guestfish --rw' for write access (but allow the default to be
  overridden in a configuration file).  This was originally planned
  for 1.10 but there's not nearly enough adoption of the new
  'guestfish --rw' option out there to do this yet.

* Write a new partition handling library to replace parted, and use it
  instead of parted.  (RHBZ#593511, RHBZ#642821).

See TODO and BUGS files.
