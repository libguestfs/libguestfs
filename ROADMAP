Roadmap for future releases
---------------------------

Before you read this:

(1) To see what's in the current release, read 'RELEASE-NOTES'.

(2) To see the list of bugs, read 'BUGS'.

(3) To understand libguestfs versioning, read section
    'LIBGUESTFS VERSION NUMBERS' of guestfs(3) man page.

(4) For general "might be good to have" items, see 'TODO'.

For next major stable release (1.10)
------------------------------------

* Continue with general reduction in use of Perl.  This is not because
  we think Perl is a bad thing or anything like that, but because a
  major consumer (RHEV) does not want to include the Perl interpreter
  in the tiny hypervisor they ship, thus any tool written in or
  requiring Perl cannot be used by RHEV.  OCaml and other high-level
  compiled languages are fine.  For 1.8 we rewrote many tools in C.

* Make 'guestfish --ro' be the default, and get users to use
  'guestfish --rw' for write access (but allow the default to be
  overridden in a configuration file).  This was originally planned
  for 1.8 but there's not nearly enough adoption of the new 'guestfish
  --rw' option out there to do this yet.

* Allow alternate methods to start the appliance, including through
  libvirt and by connecting to an existing appliance.  This was
  originally planned for 1.8 but we didn't get patches in time.

* Deeper and wider support for progress messages.  Many long-running
  operations in guestfs-browser don't display progress messages, eg.
  "du", "tar-in/out", because it's hard to estimate the runtime of
  these commands.  We should modify the protocol so that the library
  can hint at when progress messages would be useful (there's no point
  going to extra lengths to generate them if on the library side no
  one is registered to listen to them), and modify the daemon to try
  harder to generate them, even if they are only estimates.  Also
  GtkProgressBar supports a "pulse mode" where it indicates activity
  with no time estimate, and we should try to support that as well.

* Better handling of partitions, including MBR extended partitions
  (RHBZ#593511, RHBZ#602997, RHBZ#642821).

Beyond 1.10
-----------

* Hot plugging of disks using QMP.  This would allow more efficient
  reuse of the appliance in some circumstances: multiple disks
  (ie. VMs) can be added in turn to the same appliance.  In particular
  this would help virt-df.

  [Note this requires upstream work on QMP, see:
  https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2011-March/msg00124.html]
