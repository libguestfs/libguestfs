miniexpect is a very simple expect-like library for C.

It has a saner interface than libexpect, and doesn't depend on Tcl.
It is also thread safe, const-correct and uses modern C standards.

It is standalone, except that it requires the PCRE (Perl Compatible
Regular Expressions) library from http://www.pcre.org/.  The PCRE
dependency is fundamental because we want to offer the most powerful
regular expression syntax to match on, but more importantly because
PCRE has a convenient way to detect partial matches which made this
library very simple to implement.

License
-------

The library was written by Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com>
and is licensed under the Library GPL (LGPL) version 2 or above.

Source is available from: http://git.annexia.org/?p=miniexpect.git;a=summary

Using the library
-----------------

If you wanted to copy the library into your own code (instead of
linking to it as a dependency), you only need to copy the two files:
miniexpect.h, miniexpect.c.

The API is documented in the manual page (miniexpect.pod / miniexpect.3).

For examples of how to use the API in reality, see the examples and
tests in the source directory.
