"Libguestfs is a library for accessing and modifying guest disk images.  "
"Amongst the things this is good for: making batch configuration changes to "
"guests, getting disk used/free statistics (see also: virt-df), migrating "
"between virtualization systems (see also: virt-p2v), performing partial "
"backups, performing partial guest clones, cloning guests and changing "
"registry/UUID/hostname info, and much else besides."
