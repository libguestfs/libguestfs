guestfs-golang - How to use libguestfs from Go

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 import "libguestfs.org/guestfs"
 
 g, errno := guestfs.Create ()
 if errno != nil {
     panic (fmt.Sprintf ("could not create handle: %s", errno))
 }
 defer g.Close ()
 if err := g.Add_drive ("test.img"); err != nil {
     panic (err)
 }
 if err := g.Launch (); err != nil {
     panic (err)
 }
 if err := g.Shutdown (); err != nil {
     panic (err)
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents how to call libguestfs from the Go
programming language.  This page just documents the differences from
the C API and gives some examples.  If you are not familiar with using
libguestfs, you also need to read L<guestfs(3)>.

=head2 IMPORTING THE MODULE

The module is called C<guestfs>.  The full package name to import is
C<libguestfs.org/guestfs>.

=head2 CREATING AND CLOSING THE HANDLE

Use either C<guestfs.Create> or C<guestfs.Create_flags> to create the
handle.  The handle is closed implicitly if it is garbage collected.
However it is probably a good idea to close it explicitly, either by
calling S<C<g.Close ()>> or by deferring the same.

=head2 ERRORS

C<guestfs.Create> and C<guestfs.Create_flags> return a simple
C<*error>, which is really just a C C<errno> wrapped up in the
appropriate golang struct.

All other calls return a C<*GuestfsError> which (if non-nil) is a
richer struct that contains the error string from libguestfs, the
errno (if available) and the operation which failed.  This can also be
converted to a string for display.

=head2 LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item *

No support for events (see L<guestfs(3)/EVENTS>).

=item *

UUIDs are not returned in structures.
