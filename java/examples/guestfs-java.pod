=head1 NAME

guestfs-java - How to use libguestfs from Java

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 import com.redhat.et.libguestfs.*;
 
 GuestFS g = new GuestFS ();
 g.add_drive_opts ("disk.img");
 g.launch ();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents how to call libguestfs from the Java
programming language.  This page just documents the differences from
the C API and gives some examples.  If you are not familiar with using
libguestfs, you also need to read L<guestfs(3)>.

=head2 CLOSING THE HANDLE

The handle is closed when it is reaped by the garbage collector.
Because libguestfs handles include a lot of state, it is also
possible to close (and hence free) them explicitly by calling
the C<close> method.

=head2 EXCEPTIONS

Errors from libguestfs functions are mapped into the
C<LibGuestFSException> exception.  This has a single parameter which
is the error message (a C<String>).

Calling any method on a closed handle raises the same exception.
