virt-v2v-support - Supported hypervisors, virtualization management
systems and guests in virt-v2v

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This page documents which foreign hypervisors, virtualization
management systems and guest types that L<virt-v2v(1)> can support.

Note this page applies to upstream virt-v2v from
L<http://libguestfs.org> and in downstream distributions of virt-v2v
sometimes features are intentionally removed, or are present but not
supported.

=head2 Hypervisors (Input)

=over 4

=item VMware ESXi

Must be managed by VMware vCenter E<ge> 5.0 unless VDDK is available.

=item OVA exported from VMware

OVAs from other hypervisors will not work.

=item VMX from VMware

VMX files generated by other hypervisors will not work.

=item RHEL 5 Xen

=item SUSE Xen

=item Citrix Xen

Citrix Xen has not been recently tested.

=item Hyper-V

Not recently tested.  Requires that you export the disk or use
L<virt-p2v(1)> on Hyper-V.

=item Direct from disk images

Only disk images exported from supported hypervisors, and using
container formats supported by qemu.

=item Physical machines

Using the L<virt-p2v(1)> tool.

=back

=head2 Hypervisors (Output)

QEMU and KVM only.

=head2 Virtualization management systems (Output)

=over 4

=item OpenStack

=item Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) 4.1 and up

=item Local libvirt

And hence L<virsh(1)>, L<virt-manager(1)>, and similar tools.

=item Local disk

=back

=head2 Guests

=over 4

=item Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

=item CentOS 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

=item Scientific Linux 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

=item Oracle Linux

=item Fedora

=item SLES 10 and up

=item OpenSUSE 10 and up

=item Debian 6 and up

=item Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04, 14.04, 16.04, and up

=item Windows XP to Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016

We use Windows internal version numbers, see
L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions>

Currently NT 5.2 to NT 6.3 are supported.

See L</WINDOWS> below for additional notes on converting Windows
guests.

=head2 Guest firmware

BIOS is supported for all guest types and hypervisors.

VMware allows you to present UEFI firmware to guests (instead of the
ordinary PC BIOS).  Virt-v2v can convert these guests, but requires
that UEFI is supported by the target hypervisor.

Currently KVM supports OVMF, an open source UEFI firmware, and can run
these guests.

Since OVMF support was only recently added to KVM (in 2014/2015), not
all target environments support UEFI guests yet:

=over 4

=item UEFI on libvirt, qemu

Supported.  Virt-v2v will generate the correct libvirt XML (metadata)
automatically, but note that the same version of OVMF must be
installed on the conversion host as is installed on the target
hypervisor, else you will have to adjust paths in the metadata.

=item UEFI on OpenStack

Not supported.

=item UEFI on oVirt or RHV

Supported since oVirt/RHV E<ge> 4.2 and virt-v2v E<ge> 1.39.12.
