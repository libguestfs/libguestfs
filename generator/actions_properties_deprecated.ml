The default is chosen when the library was compiled by the

You can also override this by setting the C<LIBGUESTFS_HV>
environment variable.

Setting C<hv> to C<NULL> restores the default qemu binary.

Note that you should call this function as early as possible
after creating the handle.  This is because some pre-launch
operations depend on testing qemu features (by running C<qemu -help>).
If the qemu binary changes, we don't retest features, and
so you might see inconsistent results.  Using the environment
variable C<LIBGUESTFS_HV> is safest of all since that picks
the qemu binary at the same time as the handle is created.|} };
