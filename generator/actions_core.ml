This call was added in version C<1.0.58>.  In previous
versions of libguestfs there was no way to get the version
number.  From C code you can use dynamic linker functions
to find out if this symbol exists (if it doesn't, then
it’s an earlier version).

This function adds a disk image called F<filename> to the handle.
F<filename> may be a regular host file or a host device.

When this function is called before C<guestfs_launch> (the
usual case) then the first time you call this function,
the disk appears in the API as F</dev/sda>, the second time
as F</dev/sdb>, and so on.

You don't necessarily need to be root when using libguestfs.  However
you obviously do need sufficient permissions to access the filename
for whatever operations you want to perform (ie. read access if you
just want to read the image or write access if you want to modify the
image).

This call checks that F<filename> exists.

F<filename> may be the special string C<\"/dev/null\">.
See L<guestfs(3)/NULL DISKS>.

The optional arguments are:

=over 4

=item C<readonly>

If true then the image is treated as read-only.  Writes are still
allowed, but they are stored in a temporary snapshot overlay which
is discarded at the end.  The disk that you add is not modified.

=item C<format>

This forces the image format.  If you omit this (or use C<guestfs_add_drive>
or C<guestfs_add_drive_ro>) then the format is automatically detected.
Possible formats include C<raw> and C<qcow2>.

Automatic detection of the format opens you up to a potential
security hole when dealing with untrusted raw-format images.
See CVE-2010-3851 and RHBZ#642934.  Specifying the format closes
this security hole.

=item C<iface>

This rarely-used option lets you emulate the behaviour of the
deprecated C<guestfs_add_drive_with_if> call (q.v.)

=item C<name>

This field used to be passed as a hint for guest inspection, but
it is no longer used.

=item C<label>

Give the disk a label.  The label should be a unique, short
string using I<only> ASCII characters C<[a-zA-Z]>.
As well as its usual name in the API (such as F</dev/sda>),
the drive will also be named F</dev/disk/guestfs/I<label>>.

See L<guestfs(3)/DISK LABELS>.

=item C<protocol>

The optional protocol argument can be used to select an alternate
source protocol.

See also: L<guestfs(3)/REMOTE STORAGE>.

=over 4

=item C<protocol = \"file\">

F<filename> is interpreted as a local file or device.
This is the default if the optional protocol parameter
is omitted.

=item C<protocol = \"ftp\"|\"ftps\"|\"http\"|\"https\"|\"tftp\">

Connect to a remote FTP, HTTP or TFTP server.
The C<server> parameter must also be supplied - see below.

See also: L<guestfs(3)/FTP, HTTP AND TFTP>

=item C<protocol = \"gluster\">

Connect to the GlusterFS server.
The C<server> parameter must also be supplied - see below.

See also: L<guestfs(3)/GLUSTER>

=item C<protocol = \"iscsi\">

Connect to the iSCSI server.
The C<server> parameter must also be supplied - see below.
The C<username> parameter may be supplied.  See below.
The C<secret> parameter may be supplied.  See below.

See also: L<guestfs(3)/ISCSI>.

=item C<protocol = \"nbd\">

Connect to the Network Block Device server.
The C<server> parameter must also be supplied - see below.

See also: L<guestfs(3)/NETWORK BLOCK DEVICE>.

=item C<protocol = \"rbd\">

Connect to the Ceph (librbd/RBD) server.
The C<server> parameter must also be supplied - see below.
The C<username> parameter may be supplied.  See below.
The C<secret> parameter may be supplied.  See below.

See also: L<guestfs(3)/CEPH>.

=item C<protocol = \"sheepdog\">

Connect to the Sheepdog server.
The C<server> parameter may also be supplied - see below.

See also: L<guestfs(3)/SHEEPDOG>.

=item C<protocol = \"ssh\">

Connect to the Secure Shell (ssh) server.

The C<server> parameter must be supplied.
The C<username> parameter may be supplied.  See below.

See also: L<guestfs(3)/SSH>.

=back

=item C<server>

For protocols which require access to a remote server, this
is a list of server(s).

 Protocol       Number of servers required
 --------       --------------------------
 file           List must be empty or param not used at all
 ftp|ftps|http|https|tftp  Exactly one
 gluster        Exactly one
 iscsi          Exactly one
 nbd            Exactly one
 rbd            Zero or more
 sheepdog       Zero or more
 ssh            Exactly one

Each list element is a string specifying a server.  The string must be
in one of the following formats:

 hostname
 hostname:port
 tcp:hostname
 tcp:hostname:port
 unix:/path/to/socket

If the port number is omitted, then the standard port number
for the protocol is used (see F</etc/services>).

=item C<username>

For the C<ftp>, C<ftps>, C<http>, C<https>, C<iscsi>, C<rbd>, C<ssh>
and C<tftp> protocols, this specifies the remote username.

If not given, then the local username is used for C<ssh>, and no authentication
is attempted for ceph.  But note this sometimes may give unexpected results, for
example if using the libvirt backend and if the libvirt backend is configured to
start the qemu appliance as a special user such as C<qemu.qemu>.  If in doubt,
specify the remote username you want.

=item C<secret>

For the C<rbd> protocol only, this specifies the ‘secret’ to use when
connecting to the remote device.  It must be base64 encoded.

If not given, then a secret matching the given username will be looked up in the
default keychain locations, or if no username is given, then no authentication
will be used.

=item C<cachemode>

Choose whether or not libguestfs will obey sync operations (safe but slow)
or not (unsafe but fast).  The possible values for this string are:

=over 4

=item C<cachemode = \"writeback\">

This is the default.

Write operations in the API do not return until a L<write(2)>
call has completed in the host [but note this does not imply
that anything gets written to disk].

Sync operations in the API, including implicit syncs caused by
filesystem journalling, will not return until an L<fdatasync(2)>
call has completed in the host, indicating that data has been
committed to disk.

=item C<cachemode = \"unsafe\">

In this mode, there are no guarantees.  Libguestfs may cache
anything and ignore sync requests.  This is suitable only
for scratch or temporary disks.

=back

=item C<discard>

Enable or disable discard (a.k.a. trim or unmap) support on this
drive.  If enabled, operations such as C<guestfs_fstrim> will be able
to discard / make thin / punch holes in the underlying host file
or device.

Possible discard settings are:

=over 4

=item C<discard = \"disable\">

Disable discard support.  This is the default.

=item C<discard = \"enable\">

Enable discard support.  Fail if discard is not possible.

=item C<discard = \"besteffort\">

Enable discard support if possible, but don't fail if it is not
supported.

Since not all backends and not all underlying systems support
discard, this is a good choice if you want to use discard if
possible, but don't mind if it doesn't work.

=back

=item C<copyonread>

The boolean parameter C<copyonread> enables copy-on-read support.
This only affects disk formats which have backing files, and causes
reads to be stored in the overlay layer, speeding up multiple reads
of the same area of disk.

The default is false.

=item C<blocksize>

This parameter sets the sector size of the disk.  Possible values are
C<512> (the default if the parameter is omitted) or C<4096>.  Use
C<4096> when handling an \"Advanced Format\" disk that uses 4K sector
size (L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format>).

Only a subset of the backends support this parameter (currently only the
libvirt and direct backends do).

This function does some minimal checks to make sure the libvirt

Disks must be accessible locally.  This often means that adding disks
from a remote libvirt connection (see L<https://libvirt.org/remote.html>)

locally too.

The optional C<libvirturi> parameter sets the libvirt URI
(see L<https://libvirt.org/uri.html>).  If this is not set then
we connect to the default libvirt URI (or one set through an
environment variable, see the libvirt documentation for full
details).

The optional C<live> flag is ignored in libguestfs E<ge> 1.48.

If the C<allowuuid> flag is true (default is false) then a UUID
I<may> be passed instead of the domain name.  The C<dom> string is
treated as a UUID first and looked up, and if that lookup fails
then we treat C<dom> as a name as usual.

The optional C<readonlydisk> parameter controls what we do for
disks which are marked E<lt>readonly/E<gt> in the libvirt XML.
Possible values are:

The transfer that was in progress (if there is one) will stop shortly
afterwards, and will return an error.  The errno (see

another error.

then after cancellation there may be a partially uploaded file.  It is
the caller’s responsibility to clean up if necessary.

There are two common places that you might call C<guestfs_user_cancel>:

In an interactive text-based program, you might call it from a
C<SIGINT> signal handler so that pressing C<^C> cancels the current
operation.  (You also need to call C<guestfs_set_pgroup> so that

The libguestfs groups, and the functions that those
groups correspond to, are listed in L<guestfs(3)/AVAILABILITY>.
You can also fetch this list at runtime by calling
C<guestfs_available_all_groups>.

The argument C<groups> is a list of group names, eg:
C<[\"inotify\", \"augeas\"]> would check for the availability of
the Linux inotify functions and Augeas (configuration file
editing) functions.

The command returns no error if I<all> requested groups are available.

It fails with an error if one or more of the requested
groups is unavailable in the appliance.

If an unknown group name is included in the
list of groups then an error is always returned.

=over 4

=item *

C<guestfs_feature_available> is the same as this call, but
with a slightly simpler to use API: that call returns a boolean
true/false instead of throwing an error.

=item *

You must call C<guestfs_launch> before calling this function.

The reason is because we don't know what groups are
supported by the appliance/daemon until it is running and can
be queried.

=item *

If a group of functions is available, this does not necessarily
mean that they will work.  You still have to check for errors
when calling individual API functions even if they are
available.

=item *

It is usually the job of distro packagers to build
complete functionality into the libguestfs appliance.
Upstream libguestfs, if built from source with all
requirements satisfied, will support everything.

=item *

This call was added in version C<1.0.80>.  In previous
versions of libguestfs all you could do would be to speculatively
execute a command to find out if the daemon implemented it.

it may be that you need to create a F</boot/grub/device.map>

C<guestfs_mkmountpoint> and C<guestfs_rmmountpoint> are
specialized calls that can be used to create extra mountpoints
before mounting the first filesystem.

These calls are I<only> necessary in some very limited circumstances,
mainly the case where you want to mount a mix of unrelated and/or
read-only filesystems together.

For example, live CDs often contain a \"Russian doll\" nest of
filesystems, an ISO outer layer, with a squashfs image inside, with
an ext2/3 image inside that.  You can unpack this as follows
in guestfish:

 add-ro Fedora-11-i686-Live.iso
 run
 mkmountpoint /cd
 mkmountpoint /sqsh
 mkmountpoint /ext3fs
 mount /dev/sda /cd
 mount-loop /cd/LiveOS/squashfs.img /sqsh
 mount-loop /sqsh/LiveOS/ext3fs.img /ext3fs

The inner filesystem is now unpacked under the /ext3fs mountpoint.

C<guestfs_mkmountpoint> is not compatible with C<guestfs_umount_all>.
You may get unexpected errors if you try to mix these calls.  It is
safest to manually unmount filesystems and remove mountpoints after use.

C<guestfs_umount_all> unmounts filesystems by sorting the paths
longest first, so for this to work for manual mountpoints, you
must ensure that the innermost mountpoints have the longest
pathnames, as in the example code above.

For more details see L<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=599503>

C<guestfs_inotify_files>.
If this is passed as C<0>, then the kernel (or previously set)
default is used.  For Linux 2.6.29 the default was 16384 events.
Beyond this limit, the kernel throws away events, but records
the fact that it threw them away by setting a flag
C<IN_Q_OVERFLOW> in the returned structure list (see
C<guestfs_inotify_read>).

Before any events are generated, you have to add some
watches to the internal watch list.  See: C<guestfs_inotify_add_watch> and
C<guestfs_inotify_rm_watch>.

Queued up events should be read periodically by calling
C<guestfs_inotify_read>
(or C<guestfs_inotify_files> which is just a helpful
wrapper around C<guestfs_inotify_read>).  If you don't
read the events out often enough then you risk the internal
queue overflowing.

The handle should be closed after use by calling
C<guestfs_inotify_close>.  This also removes any
watches automatically.

See also L<inotify(7)> for an overview of the inotify interface
as exposed by the Linux kernel, which is roughly what we expose

This can be used to resolve case insensitive paths on

to resolve paths which you have read from Windows configuration

The command handles a peculiarity of the Linux ntfs-3g
filesystem driver (and probably others), which is that although
the underlying filesystem is case-insensitive, the driver
exports the filesystem to Linux as case-sensitive.

One consequence of this is that special directories such
as F<C:\\windows> may appear as F</WINDOWS> or F</windows>
(or other things) depending on the precise details of how
they were created.  In Windows itself this would not be
a problem.

C<guestfs_case_sensitive_path> attempts to resolve the true case of
each element in the path. It will return a resolved path if either the
full path or its parent directory exists. If the parent directory
exists but the full path does not, the case of the parent directory
will be correctly resolved, and the remainder appended unmodified. For
example, if the file C<\"/Windows/System32/netkvm.sys\"> exists:

let you copy from a source (device|file) to a destination
(device|file).

Partial copies can be made since you can specify optionally
the source offset, destination offset and size to copy.  These
values are all specified in bytes.  If not given, the offsets
both default to zero, and the size defaults to copying as much
as possible until we hit the end of the source.

The source and destination may be the same object.  However
overlapping regions may not be copied correctly.

If the destination is a file, it is created if required.  If
the destination file is not large enough, it is extended.

If the destination is a file and the C<append> flag is not set,
then the destination file is truncated.  If the C<append> flag is
set, then the copy appends to the destination file.  The C<append>
flag currently cannot be set for devices.

If the C<sparse> flag is true then the call avoids writing
blocks that contain only zeroes, which can help in some situations
where the backing disk is thin-provisioned.  Note that unless

in incorrect copying." };

=item C<force>

Force tune2fs to complete the operation even in the face of errors.
This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-f> option.

=item C<maxmountcount>

Set the number of mounts after which the filesystem is checked
by L<e2fsck(8)>.  If this is C<0> then the number of mounts is
disregarded.  This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-c> option.

=item C<mountcount>

Set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted.
This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-C> option.

=item C<errorbehavior>

Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are detected.
Possible values currently are: C<continue>, C<remount-ro>, C<panic>.
In practice these options don't really make any difference,
particularly for write errors.

This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-e> option.

=item C<group>

Set the group which can use reserved filesystem blocks.
This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-g> option except that it
can only be specified as a number.

=item C<intervalbetweenchecks>

Adjust the maximal time between two filesystem checks
(in seconds).  If the option is passed as C<0> then
time-dependent checking is disabled.

This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-i> option.

=item C<reservedblockspercentage>

Set the percentage of the filesystem which may only be allocated
by privileged processes.
This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-m> option.

=item C<lastmounteddirectory>

Set the last mounted directory.
This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-M> option.

=item C<reservedblockscount>
Set the number of reserved filesystem blocks.
This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-r> option.

=item C<user>

Set the user who can use the reserved filesystem blocks.
This is the same as the L<tune2fs(8)> C<-u> option except that it
can only be specified as a number.

=item C<missingbitmap>

A bitmap of missing devices.  If a bit is set it means that a
missing device is added to the array.  The least significant bit
corresponds to the first device in the array.

As examples:

If C<devices = [\"/dev/sda\"]> and C<missingbitmap = 0x1> then
the resulting array would be C<[E<lt>missingE<gt>, \"/dev/sda\"]>.

If C<devices = [\"/dev/sda\"]> and C<missingbitmap = 0x2> then
the resulting array would be C<[\"/dev/sda\", E<lt>missingE<gt>]>.

C<missingbitmap> must equal C<nrdevices> + C<spare>.

=item C<nrdevices>

the number of bits set in C<missingbitmap>.

=item C<chunk>

The chunk size in bytes.

The C<chunk> parameter does not make sense, and should not be specified,
when C<level> is C<raid1> (which is the default; see below).

=item C<level>

The RAID level, which can be one of:

The characters (file attributes) in the returned string are
currently:

=item 'A'

When the file is accessed, its atime is not modified.

=item 'a'

The file is append-only.

=item 'c'

The file is compressed on-disk.

=item 'D'

(Directories only.)  Changes to this directory are written
synchronously to disk.

=item 'd'

The file is not a candidate for backup (see L<dump(8)>).

=item 'E'

The file has compression errors.

=item 'e'

The file is using extents.

=item 'h'

The file is storing its blocks in units of the filesystem blocksize
instead of sectors.

=item 'I'

(Directories only.)  The directory is using hashed trees.

=item 'i'

The file is immutable.  It cannot be modified, deleted or renamed.
No link can be created to this file.

=item 'j'

The file is data-journaled.

=item 's'

When the file is deleted, all its blocks will be zeroed.

=item 'S'

Changes to this file are written synchronously to disk.

=item 'T'

(Directories only.)  This is a hint to the block allocator
that subdirectories contained in this directory should be
spread across blocks.  If not present, the block allocator
will try to group subdirectories together.

=item 't'

For a file, this disables tail-merging.
(Not used by upstream implementations of ext2.)

=item 'u'

When the file is deleted, its blocks will be saved, allowing
the file to be undeleted.

=item 'X'

The raw contents of the compressed file may be accessed.

=item 'Z'

The compressed file is dirty.

x86 Linux vmlinuz kernels

x86 vmlinuz images (bzImage format) consist of a mix of 16-, 32- and
compressed code, and are horribly hard to unpack.  If you want to find
the architecture of a kernel, use the architecture of the associated
initrd or kernel module(s) instead.

    longdesc = "\
This inspection command looks for filesystems on partitions,
block devices and logical volumes, returning a list of C<mountables>
containing filesystems and their type.

The return value is a hash, where the keys are the devices
containing filesystems, and the values are the filesystem types.
For example:

 \"/dev/sda1\" => \"ntfs\"
 \"/dev/sda2\" => \"ext2\"
 \"/dev/vg_guest/lv_root\" => \"ext4\"
 \"/dev/vg_guest/lv_swap\" => \"swap\"

The key is not necessarily a block device. It may also be an opaque
‘mountable’ string which can be passed to C<guestfs_mount>.

The value can have the special value \"unknown\", meaning the
content of the device is undetermined or empty.
\"swap\" means a Linux swap partition.

In libguestfs E<le> 1.36 this command ran other libguestfs commands,
which might have included C<guestfs_mount> and C<guestfs_umount>, and
therefore you had to use this soon after launch and only when
nothing else was mounted.  This restriction is removed in libguestfs
E<ge> 1.38.

Not all of the filesystems returned will be mountable.  In
particular, swap partitions are returned in the list.  Also
this command does not check that each filesystem
found is valid and mountable, and some filesystems might
be mountable but require special options.  Filesystems may
not all belong to a single logical operating system
(use C<guestfs_inspect_os> to look for OSes)." };
