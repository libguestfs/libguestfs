The list returned is empty if no operating systems were found.

If one operating system was found, then this returns a list with
a single element, which is the name of the root filesystem of
this operating system.  It is also possible for this function
to return a list containing more than one element, indicating
a dual-boot or multi-boot virtual machine, with each element being
the root filesystem of one of the operating systems.

You can pass the root string(s) returned to other
C<guestfs_inspect_get_*> functions in order to query further
information about each operating system, such as the name
and version.

This function uses other libguestfs features such as
C<guestfs_mount_ro> and C<guestfs_umount_all> in order to mount
and unmount filesystems and look at the contents.  This should
be called with no disks currently mounted.  The function may also
use Augeas, so any existing Augeas handle will be closed.

This function cannot decrypt encrypted disks.  The caller
must do that first (supplying the necessary keys) if the
disk is encrypted.

managers that use this.  If unavailable this is returned as an empty
string C<"">.

=item C<app2_install_path>

The installation path of the application (on operating systems
such as Windows which use installation paths).  This path is
in the format used by the guest operating system, it is not
a libguestfs path.

If unavailable this is returned as an empty string C<"">.

=item *

Unlike most other inspection API calls, the guest’s disks must be
mounted up before you call this, since it needs to read information
from the guest filesystem during the call.

=item *

B<Security:> The icon data comes from the untrusted guest,
and should be treated with caution.  PNG files have been
known to contain exploits.  Ensure that libpng (or other relevant
libraries) are fully up to date before trying to process or
display the icon.

=item *

The PNG image returned can be any size.  It might not be square.
Libguestfs tries to return the largest, highest quality
icon available.  The application must scale the icon to the
required size.

=item *

Extracting icons from Windows guests requires the external
L<wrestool(1)> program from the C<icoutils> package, and
several programs (L<bmptopnm(1)>, L<pnmtopng(1)>, L<pamcut(1)>)
from the C<netpbm> package.  These must be installed separately.

Operating system icons are usually trademarks.  Seek legal
advice before using trademarks in applications.
