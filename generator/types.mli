(** Types used to describe the API. *)

type style = ret * args * optargs
(** The [style] is a tuple which describes the return value and
    arguments of a function.

    [ret] is the return value, one of the [R*] values below.

    The second element is the list of required arguments, a list of
    [argt]s from the list below, eg. [Bool], [String] etc.  Each has
    a name so that for example [Int "foo"] corresponds in the C
    bindings to an [int foo] parameter.

    The third element is the list of optional arguments.  These are
    mapped to optional arguments in the language binding, eg. in
    Perl to:
{v
      $g->fn (required1, required2, opt1 => val, opt2 => val);
v}
    As the name suggests these are optional, and the function can
    tell which optional parameters were supplied by the caller. *)

and ret =
  | RErr
(** "RErr" as a return value means an int used as a simple error
    indication, ie. 0 or -1. *)

  | RInt of string
(** "RInt" as a return value means an int which is -1 for error
    or any value >= 0 on success.  Only use this for smallish
    positive ints (0 <= i < 2^30). *)

  | RInt64 of string
(** "RInt64" is the same as RInt, but is guaranteed to be able
    to return a full 64 bit value, _except_ that -1 means error
    (so -1 cannot be a valid, non-error return value). *)

  | RBool of string
(** "RBool" is a bool return value which can be true/false or
    -1 for error. *)

  | RConstString of string
(** "RConstString" is a string that refers to a constant value.
    The return value must NOT be NULL (since NULL indicates
    an error).

    Try to avoid using this.  In particular you cannot use this
    for values returned from the daemon, because there is no
    thread-safe way to return them in the C API. *)

  | RConstOptString of string
(** "RConstOptString" is an even more broken version of
     "RConstString".  The returned string may be NULL and there
     is no way to return an error indication.  Avoid using this! *)

  | RString of rstringt * string
(** "RString" is a returned string.  It must NOT be NULL, since
    a NULL return indicates an error.  The caller frees this. *)

  | RStringList of rstringt * string
(** "RStringList" is a list of strings.  No string in the list
    can be NULL.  The caller frees the strings and the array. *)

  | RStruct of string * string		(* name of retval, name of struct *)
(** "RStruct" is a function which returns a single named structure
    or an error indication (in C, a struct, and in other languages
    with varying representations, but usually very efficient).  See
    after the function list below for the structures. *)

  | RStructList of string * string	(* name of retval, name of struct *)
(** "RStructList" is a function which returns either a list/array
    of structures (could be zero-length), or an error indication. *)

  | RHashtable of rstringt * rstringt * string
(** Key-value pairs of untyped strings.  Turns into a hashtable or
    dictionary in languages which support it.

    DON'T use this as a general "bucket" for results.  Prefer a
    stronger typed return value if one is available, or write a
    custom struct.  Don't use this if the list could potentially
    be very long, since it is inefficient.

    Keys should be unique.  NULLs are not permitted.
    The first rstringt is the type of the keys, the second
    rstringt is the type of the values. *)

  | RBufferOut of string
(** "RBufferOut" is handled almost exactly like RString, but
    it allows the string to contain arbitrary 8 bit data including
    ASCII NUL.  In the C API this causes an implicit extra parameter
    to be added of type <size_t *size_r>.  The extra parameter
    returns the actual size of the return buffer in bytes.

    Other programming languages support strings with arbitrary 8 bit
    data.

    At the RPC layer we have to use the opaque<> type instead of
    string<>.  Returned data is still limited to the max message
    size (ie. ~ 2 MB). *)

and rstringt =
  | RPlainString        (** none of the others *)
  | RDevice             (** /dev device name *)
  | RMountable          (** location of mountable filesystem *)

and args = argt list	(** Function parameters, guestfs handle is implicit. *)

and argt =
  | Bool of string	(** boolean *)
  | Int of string	(** int (smallish ints, signed, <= 31 bits) *)
  | Int64 of string	(** any 64 bit int *)

  | String of stringt * string
  (** Strings: These can be plain strings, device names, mountable
      filesystems, etc.  They cannot be NULL. *)

  | OptString of string	(** Plain string, may be NULL. *)

  | StringList of stringt * string
  (** List of strings: The strings may be plain strings, device names
      etc., but all of the same type.  The strings cannot be NULL. *)

  | BufferIn of string
  (** Opaque buffer which can contain arbitrary 8 bit data.
      In the C API, this is expressed as <const char *, size_t> pair.
      Most other languages have a string type which can contain
      ASCII NUL.  We use whatever type is appropriate for each
      language.

      Buffers are limited by the total message size.  To transfer
      large blocks of data, use FileIn/FileOut parameters instead.
      To return an arbitrary buffer, use RBufferOut. *)

  | Pointer of (string * string)
  (** This specifies an opaque pointer that is passed through
      untouched.  Only non-daemon functions are supported.

      Pointer ("foo *", "bar") translates to "foo *bar" in the
      C API.  The pointer ("bar") cannot be NULL.

      This is less well supported in other language bindings:
      if the pointer type is known then we may be able to produce
      a suitable binding, otherwise this is translated into a 64
      bit int.

      Functions with this parameter type are not supported at all
      in guestfish (the function must be declared "NotInFish" else
      you will get an error).  Also the function cannot contain
      tests, although we should fix this in future. *)

and stringt =
  | PlainString         (** none of the others *)
  | Device              (** /dev device name *)
  | Mountable           (** location of mountable filesystem *)

  | Pathname
  (** An absolute path within the appliance filesystem. *)

  | FileIn
  | FileOut
  (** These are treated as filenames (simple string parameters) in
      the C API and bindings.  But in the RPC protocol, we transfer
      the actual file content up to or down from the daemon.
      FileIn: local machine -> daemon (in request)
      FileOut: daemon -> local machine (in reply)
      In guestfish (only), the special name "-" means read from
      stdin or write to stdout. *)

  | Key
  (** Key material / passphrase.  Eventually we should treat this
      as sensitive and mlock it into physical RAM.  However this
      is highly complex because of all the places that XDR-encoded
      strings can end up.  So currently the only difference from
      'PlainString' is the way that guestfish requests these
      parameters from the user. *)

  | GUID
  (** A GUID string.

      It cannot be NULL, and it will be validated using
      guestfs_int_validate_guid. *)

  | Filename
  (** A simple filename (not a path nor a relative path).  It cannot
      be NULL, empty, or anything different than a simple file name. *)

    (* The following two are DEPRECATED and must not be used in
     * any new APIs.

  | Dev_or_Path         (** Device or Pathname. *)
  | Mountable_or_Path   (** Mountable or Pathname. *)

and c_api_test_init =

      instead of MBR. *)

  | InitBasicFS
  (** /dev/sda contains a single partition /dev/sda1, which is formatted
      as ext2, empty [except for lost+found] and mounted on /.
      No LVM.

      Note: for testing filesystem operations, it is quicker to use
      InitScratchFS *)

  | InitBasicFSonLVM
  (** /dev/sda:
        /dev/sda1 (is a PV):
          /dev/VG/LV (size 8MB):
            formatted as ext2, empty [except for lost+found], mounted on /

      on LVM.  Normally you should use InitScratchFS instead. *)

  | InitISOFS
  (** /dev/sdd (the ISO, see images/ directory in source)
      is mounted on / *)

  | InitScratchFS
  (** /dev/sdb1 (write scratch disk) is mounted on /.  The filesystem
      will be empty.

      Note that this filesystem is not recreated between tests, and
      could contain random files and directories from previous tests.
      Therefore it is recommended that you create uniquely named files
      and directories for your tests. *)
