data field from a hivex value tuple).  It then assumes that
the field is a UTF-16LE string and converts the result to
UTF-8 (or if this is not possible, it returns an error).

This is useful for reading strings out of the Windows registry.
However it is not foolproof because the registry is not
strongly-typed and fields can contain arbitrary or unexpected
data.|} };
