Ideas for the Python bindings:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-virt/2009-April/msg00114.html

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We badly need to actually implement the FTP server mentioned in the
documentation.

Or: Implement a FUSE-based filesystem.  See the FUSE mountlo
project which does something similar, albeit only to single
filesystems:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=121684&package_id=150116

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BufferIn should turn into <char *, int> and simple strings in other
languages that can handle 8 bit clean strings.

Limit on transfers would still be 2MB for these types.
 - then implement write-file properly

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement febootstrap command.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete the Haskell bindings (see discussion on haskell-cafe).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete the bindings tests - must test the return values and
error cases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

For virt-inspector:

 - Make a libvirt XML config

 - Test over available OSes

 - Add 'reged' / NT registry support.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use virtio_blk by default.  It's faster and more natural.
Unfortunately it seems like this will rename all devices - see next
item.

Note: virtio_blk *IS* supported by all our minimum platforms,
ie. CentOS 5.3, Fedora 11, Debian.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Standalone/local mode"

Instead of running guestfsd (the daemon) inside qemu, there should be
an option to just run guestfsd directly.

The architecture in this mode would look like:

     +------------------+
     | main program     |
     |------------------|
     | libguestfs       |
     +--------^---------+
          |   | reply
      cmd |   |
     +----v-------------+
     | guestfsd         |
     +------------------+

Notes:

(1) This only makes sense if we are running as root.

(2) There is no console / kernel messages in this configuration, but
we might consider capturing stderr from the daemon.

(3) guestfs_config and guestfs_add_drive become no-ops.

Obviously in this configuration, commands are run directly on the
local machine's disks.  You could just run the commands themselves
directly, but libguestfs provides a convenient API and language
bindings.  Also deals with tricky stuff like parsing the output of the
LVM commands.  Also we get to leverage other code such as
virt-inspector.

This is mainly useful from live CDs, ie. virt-p2v.

Should we bother having the daemon at all and just link the guestfsd
code directly into libguestfs?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PPC problems:

  ppc (32 bit) works with qemu from git, however there is no serial console

  ppc64 requires extra parameters:
    -M mac99 -cpu ppc64
  however it still fails:
    invalid/unsupported opcode: 01 - 01 - 1a (06301e83) 00000000018c2738 1
    invalid bits: 00400000 for opcode: 0b - 19 - 15 (2d746572) 0000000000009230

  no serial console in ppc or ppc64 because no one can tell us what
  console=ttyXX option to use

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Supermin appliance should be moved into febootstrap.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Extra commands / functionality:

  General glibc / core programs:
    chgrp
    grep (do it locally using pipe?)
    dd (?)
    ln / ln -s
    readlink
    utime / utimes / futimes / futimens / l..
    more mk*temp calls
    some sort of alloc/fallocate/posix_fallocate call to create empty space
    realpath
    trunc[ate??]

  ext2 properties:
    chattr
    lsattr
    badblocks
    blkid
    debugfs
    dumpe2fs
    e2image
    e2undo
    filefrag
    findfs
    logsave
    mklost+found

  SELinux:
    chcat
    restorecon
    ch???

  Oddball:
    pivot_root
    fts(3) / ftw(3)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Allow swap space from the guest to be used.  Is it a good idea?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Need a way to query a binary or library file for its architecture.
Using objdump or readelf?
What about non-ELF files (eg. Windows, BSD).

To do this properly requires some serious logic, eg. to cover Linux
and Windows we'd need objdump and i686-pc-mingw32-objdump, and more to
cover a.out, COFF and 64 bit Windows.  Therefore this cannot be done
inside the daemon, and should be done by a separate, external program
similar to virt-inspector.

Probably we should go all the way and have virt-inspector able to
determine kernel and userspace architectures of guests.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other initrd-* commands, such as:

initrd-extract
initrd-replace

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some easy non-Augeas methods to edit configuration files.
I'm thinking:

  replace /etc/file key value

which would look in /etc/file for any instances of

  key=...
  key ...
  key:...

and replace them with

  key=value
  key value
  key:value

That would solve about 50% of reconfiguration needs, and for the
rest you'd use Augeas, 'download'+'upload' or 'edit'.
