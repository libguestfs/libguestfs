=head1 NAME

guestmount - Mount a guest filesystem on the host using FUSE and libguestfs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 guestmount [--options] -a disk.img -m device [--ro] mountpoint

=head1 WARNING

You must I<not> use C<guestmount> in read-write mode on live virtual
machines.  If you do this, you risk disk corruption in the VM.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The guestmount program can be used to mount virtual machine
filesystems and other disk images on the host.  It uses libguestfs for
access to the guest filesystem, and FUSE (the "filesystem in
userspace") to make it appear as a mountable device.

Along with other options, you have to give at least one device (I<-a>
option) and at least one mountpoint (I<-m> option).  How this works is
better explained in the L<guestfish(1)> manual page, or you can use
L<virt-inspector(1)> and/or the the wrapper script
C<guestmount-wrapper> to help you.

FUSE lets you mount filesystems as non-root.  The mountpoint must be
owned by you, and the filesystem will not be visible to any other
users unless you make certain global configuration changes to
C</etc/fuse.conf>.  To unmount the filesystem, use the C<fusermount -u>
command.

=head1 EXAMPLES

For a typical Windows guest which has its main filesystem on the
first partition:

 guestmount -a windows.img -m /dev/sda1 --ro /mnt

For a typical Linux guest which has a /boot filesystem on the first
partition, and the root filesystem on a logical volume:

 guestmount -a linux.img -m /dev/VG/LV -m /dev/sda1:/boot --ro /mnt

To get L<virt-inspector(1)> to do the hard work of detecting guest
mountpoints for you:

 guestmount $(virt-inspector --ro-fish MyGuest) /mnt

(or use --fish if you don't want it to be a read only mount).  The
option is called I<--ro-fish> or I<--fish> because these parameters
are compatible with L<guestfish(1)>.

If you want to trace the libguestfs calls but without excessive
debugging, we recommend:

 guestmount [-a ... -m ...] --trace /mnt

If you want to debug the program, we recommend:

 guestmount [-a ... -m ...] --trace --verbose /mnt

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-a image> | B<--add image>

Add a block device or virtual machine image.

=item B<--dir-cache-timeout N>

Set the readdir cache timeout to I<N> seconds, the default being 60
seconds.  The readdir cache [actually, there are several
semi-independent caches] is populated after a readdir(2) call with the
stat and extended attributes of the files in the directory, in
anticipation that they will be requested soon after.

There is also a different attribute cache implemented by FUSE
(see the FUSE option I<-o attr_timeout>), but the FUSE cache
does not anticipate future requests, only cache existing ones.

=item B<--fuse-help>

Display help on special FUSE options (see I<-o> below).

=item B<--help>

Display brief help and exit.

=item B<-m dev[:mnt]> | B<--mount dev[:mnt]>

Mount the named partition or logical volume on the given mountpoint
B<in the guest> (this has nothing to do with mountpoints in the host).

If the mountpoint is omitted, it defaults to C</>.  You have to mount
something on C</>.

=item B<-n> | B<--no-sync>

By default, we attempt to sync the guest disk when the FUSE mountpoint
is unmounted.  If you specify this option, then we don't attempt to
sync the disk.  See the discussion of autosync in the L<guestfs(3)>
manpage.

=item B<-o option> | B<--option option>

Pass extra options to FUSE.

To get a list of all the extra options supported by FUSE, use the
command below.  Note that only the FUSE I<-o> options can be passed,
and only some of them are a good idea.

 guestmount --fuse-help

Some potentially useful FUSE options:

=over 4

=item B<-o allow_other>

Allow other users to see the filesystem.

=item B<-o attr_timeout=N>

Enable attribute caching by FUSE, and set the timeout to I<N> seconds.

=item B<-o kernel_cache>

Allow the kernel to cache files (reduces the number of reads
that have to go through the L<guestfs(3)> API).  This is generally
a good idea if you can afford the extra memory usage.

=item B<-o uid=N> B<-o gid=N>

Use these options to map all UIDs and GIDs inside the guest filesystem
to the chosen values.

=back

=item B<-r> | B<--ro>

Add devices and mount everything read-only.  Also disallow writes and
make the disk appear read-only to FUSE.

This is highly recommended if you are not going to edit the guest
disk.  If the guest is running and this option is I<not> supplied,
then there is a strong risk of disk corruption in the guest.  We try
to prevent this from happening, but it is not always possible.

=item B<--selinux>

Enable SELinux support for the guest.

=item B<--trace>

Trace libguestfs calls (to stderr).

This also stops the daemon from forking into the background.

=item B<-v> | B<--verbose>

Enable verbose messages from underlying libguestfs.

=item B<-V> | B<--version>

Display the program version and exit.
