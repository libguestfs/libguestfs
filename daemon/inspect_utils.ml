   * objects (eg. devices), passing them to Augeas, so relying on
   * Augeas to do the right thing.  Also too-large regular files
   * caused the whole inspection operation to fail.
   *
   * I have tried to improve this so that non-regular files and
   * too large files are ignored (dropped from the configfiles list),
   * so that Augeas won't touch them, but they also won't stop
   * inspection.
